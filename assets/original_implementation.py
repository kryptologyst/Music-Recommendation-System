# Project 358. Music recommendation system
# Description:
# A music recommendation system suggests songs or albums to users based on:

# User preferences (e.g., genre, artist, mood)

# Music features (e.g., genre, tempo, lyrics)

# In this project, we’ll build a music recommendation system using content-based filtering, where we recommend music based on the features of the music and the user’s preferences.

# 🧪 Python Implementation (Music Recommendation System):
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
 
# 1. Simulate music tracks and their features (e.g., genre, mood, artist)
tracks = ['Song1', 'Song2', 'Song3', 'Song4', 'Song5']
track_features = [
    "Upbeat pop song with catchy lyrics, perfect for a workout playlist.",
    "Slow ballad with emotional lyrics, ideal for a romantic evening.",
    "Fast-paced rock song with heavy guitar riffs, great for an adrenaline boost.",
    "Electronic dance music with high tempo, ideal for a clubbing night.",
    "Classical piano piece, calm and soothing for relaxation or studying."
]
 
# 2. Simulate user preferences (e.g., favorite genres, artists, or mood)
user_profile = "I enjoy upbeat songs with catchy lyrics and electronic music."
 
# 3. Use TF-IDF to convert track features and user profile into numerical features
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(track_features + [user_profile])  # Combine track features and user profile
 
# 4. Function to recommend music based on user preferences
def music_recommendation(user_profile, tracks, tfidf_matrix, top_n=3):
    # Compute the cosine similarity between the user profile and track features
    cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[-1], tfidf_matrix[:-1]).flatten()
    
    # Get the indices of the most similar tracks
    similar_indices = cosine_sim.argsort()[-top_n:][::-1]
    
    recommended_tracks = [tracks[i] for i in similar_indices]
    return recommended_tracks
 
# 5. Recommend music tracks based on the user profile
recommended_tracks = music_recommendation(user_profile, tracks, tfidf_matrix)
print(f"Music Recommendations based on your profile: {recommended_tracks}")


# ✅ What It Does:
# Uses TF-IDF to convert music features (e.g., genre, lyrics) and the user profile into numerical features

# Computes cosine similarity to measure how similar the user’s preferences are to each music track

# Recommends top music tracks based on content similarity between the user’s profile and music features
